graphs are defined as follows:
the line represents the node number, then the color as a single character, then the size as a number, and finally, the nodes it is connected to.
e.g. line 5 will be decoded on line 6
Y, M, (4, 3, 7)
Node 5 is yellow, medium, and connected to nodes 4, 3, and 7
sizes are L/M/S (large, medium, small)
